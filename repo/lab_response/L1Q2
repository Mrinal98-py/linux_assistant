L1Q2  -  Write a C program to assign values to each member of the following structure.
Pass the populated structure to a function Using call-by-value and another function using call-by-address and print the value of each member of the structure.
struct student_info{
int roll_no;
char name [50];
float CGPA;
struct dob age;
};

Explanation -  In this question, we are required to define a structure named student_info that contains the following members:

    1. roll_no - an integer representing the roll number of the student.
    2. name - a character array (string) to store the name of the student.
    3. CGPA - a float to store the Cumulative Grade Point Average of the student.
    4. age - a structure of type dob that represents the date of birth.
We will populate the student_info structure with values and pass it to two different functions. One function will receive the structure using call-by-value, and the other function will receive it using call-by-address (pointer). Both functions will print the values of the structure members.

Code - #include <stdio.h>

// Define the structure for date of birth
struct dob {
    int day;
    int month;
    int year;
};

// Define the main structure for student information
struct student_info {
    int roll_no;
    char name[50];
    float CGPA;
    struct dob age;
};

// Function to print student information received by value
void printStudentInfoByValue(struct student_info student) {
    printf("Printing student information using call-by-value:\n");
    printf("Roll Number: %d\n", student.roll_no);
    printf("Name: %s\n", student.name);
    printf("CGPA: %.2f\n", student.CGPA);
    printf("Date of Birth: %d-%d-%d\n", student.age.day, student.age.month, student.age.year);
}

// Function to print student information received by address
void printStudentInfoByAddress(const struct student_info *student) {
    printf("Printing student information using call-by-address:\n");
    printf("Roll Number: %d\n", student->roll_no);
    printf("Name: %s\n", student->name);
    printf("CGPA: %.2f\n", student->CGPA);
    printf("Date of Birth: %d-%d-%d\n", student->age.day, student->age.month, student->age.year);
}

int main() {
    // Create a student_info structure and populate it with values
    struct student_info student1 = {101, "John Doe", 3.75, {15, 8, 2000}};

    // Call the functions to print the student information
    printStudentInfoByValue(student1);
    printStudentInfoByAddress(&student1);

    return 0;
}
