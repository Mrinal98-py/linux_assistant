L1Q1 - Write a C program to swap the content of 2 variables entered through the command line using function and pointer.

Explanation - Create a C program that swaps the content of two variables entered through the command line using a function and pointers.
We ask the user to enter values for variable a and b. We pass the address of variable a and b to function swap(). Inside function swap() we take a local variable temp. Since address of variable a and b are passed to swap() method, we take 2 pointer variables *x and *y. Pointer variable x holds the address of a and pointer variable y holds the address of b. Using below logic we swap the values present at address a( or x ) and b( or y ). 
temp = *x;
*x = *y;
*y = temp;
 Since we are directly changing the value present at particular address, the value gets reflected throughout the program and not just inside particular function. Thatâ€™s why we are able to print the result inside main function and the values of variable a and b are swapped, without getting any returned value from function swap().

Code -  #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Function to swap two integers using pointers
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 3) {
        printf("Usage: %s <value1> <value2>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    int num1 = atoi(argv[1]); // Convert the first command-line argument to an integer
    int num2 = atoi(argv[2]); // Convert the second command-line argument to an integer

    printf("Before swapping: num1 = %d, num2 = %d\n", num1, num2);

    // Call the swap function to swap the values of num1 and num2
    swap(&num1, &num2);

    printf("After swapping: num1 = %d, num2 = %d\n", num1, num2);

    return 0;
}
